  Act 1 Outline:

      Introduction of characters:
          Elysia: A 34-year-old skilled linguist and cryptographer with hidden witchcraft powers, works at the city's prestigious museum.
          Morwenna: An ancient witch with near-immortality, appears to be in her mid-20s.

      Area of expertise for the heroine:
          Elysia's expertise in ancient languages and artifacts leads Morwenna to seek her help in decoding a cryptic message inscribed on an artifact connected to the origins of witchcraft.

      Build-up to the second encounter:
          Elysia's witchcraft powers resonate with the artifact, causing her to experience vivid dreams and visions related to its history.
          Intrigued by these visions and suspecting Morwenna's involvement, Elysia seeks her out at her townhouse.
          Morwenna, wary of letting Elysia enter her magically-protected home, suggests they take a walk along the city's river.
          During their walk, they are attacked by a magical creature drawn to their combined magical energy.

      Cautious approaches and recruiting phase:
          Elysia frequently visits Morwenna, but Morwenna remains cautious due to the dangers of two witches spending time together, especially when one is untrained.
          Elysia's witchcraft becomes more active around Morwenna, leading to minor magical incidents that Morwenna manages to suppress or explain away.

      Proposal and rejection:
          Morwenna reveals herself as a witch to Elysia and proposes to teach her how to control her powers to prevent the dark magical activity from escalating.
          Elysia, overwhelmed with guilt and fear, rejects Morwenna's offer, believing her powers are a curse.

      Catalyst for reconsideration:
          An accident in the museum, caused by Elysia's uncontrolled magic, destroys a priceless artifact and severely injures a coworker.
          Overwhelmed with guilt and understanding the potential consequences of her uncontrolled powers, Elysia reconsiders Morwenna's proposal.

      Consequences of the failed magical connection:
          The failed magical connection creates an arcane rift within Morwenna's home, causing it to become a focal point for a slow, creeping corruption that begins to spread throughout the city.

      Fleeing the city:
          A terrifying and powerful being breaches the rift and takes over Morwenna's home, forcing Elysia and Morwenna to flee.
          The being's ability to pursue and locate the witches is limited by its connection to the arcane rift and the phases of the moon (future plot point).
          Elysia and Morwenna embark on a journey to master their powers and find a way to close the arcane rift, with the ever-present threat of the malevolent entity looming over them.
